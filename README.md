Retail Chain is a polygon(MATIC) powered technology that utilizes the nature of Blockchain claims and zero knowledge proof to authenticate and verify the quality, quantity and originality of diverse good in industrial manufacturing.
 It enables wholesale merchants to qurey the originality of goods from the manufacturer who makes a claim that must be verified by the warehouse official.
Both the manufacturer and warehouse official must sign a contract call to ensure that every aspect of the claim is verified.
The Retail Chain smart contract thus enables manufacturers make claims that must be verified and only then does real trust come into play since one is sure on the consensus reached on the Blockchain

Looking at the industrialization of the 21st century it is almost impossible to turn a blind eye to many of the challenges that affect consumer protection, quality assurance, and originality checks; these challenges our team investigated an found that they all arise from the inability, or delay and difficulty of manufacturers and warehouse management to reach consensus.
 Inspired by the various negative consequences that affects our local communities which lack the ability to protect themselves from the laxity of manufacturers and wholesale merchants we created 'Retail Chain', an attempt to cutail fake, low quality, unreliable goods from reaching the defenseless end user.
This solution is founded on the ground that if goods can be reliably, fast and securely verified between the manufacturer and wholesale managements at every moment of need; the risk of bad, incomplete, frauded goods reaching the consumer is greatly reduced.
We envision a world that is safe for everyone.
The future of Retail Chain
Retail Chain goes beyond here. Our team plans to scale the functionality of the Retail Chain smart contract to suite and tackle every problem in the manufacturing industry the affects the authenticity of goods.
We plan to also integrate the POLYGON ID project by POLYGON to facilitate identification of manufacturers and warehouse management utilizing zero knowledge proof to further more allow transparency into every aspect of the goods in question. In the near future Retail Chain users can directly query authenticity and originality of products they use and get real-time response from both manufacturers and warehouse officials.
